<!-- ========== SECTION: THREE PILLARS ========== -->

## Three Powerful Tabs. One Complete Picture.

Argus organizes everything into three focused tabs — Extract, Audit, and Insights — so you spend less time hunting for information and more time acting on it. Each tab is purpose-built for a different phase of on-page SEO analysis.

### Extract — See Everything Search Engines See

<!-- Icon suggestion: magnifying glass or eye icon -->

Stop guessing what your pages are telling Google, Facebook, and Twitter. The Extract tab pulls every meaningful tag and structural element from the current page and presents it in a clean, scannable format. You get instant visibility into the signals that determine how your content appears in search results and social feeds.

- **Meta tags** — title, description, robots, canonical, viewport, and every other `<meta>` element
- **Open Graph tags** — full og:title, og:description, og:image, og:type, og:url, and all variants
- **Twitter Card tags** — card type, title, description, image, site, and creator
- **JSON-LD structured data** — schema.org markup with syntax highlighting and validation
- **Heading hierarchy** — every H1 through H6, in document order, so you can spot structural issues instantly
- **Links** — internal, external, and anchor link counts with details
- **Images** — image inventory with alt text presence checks

### Audit — Know Your Score in Seconds

<!-- Icon suggestion: clipboard with checkmark or gauge/speedometer -->

A meta tag extractor tells you what's there. An SEO audit tool tells you what's wrong and what's missing. Argus runs over 40 rule-based checks the moment you open the panel, scoring your page from 0 to 100 across 10 weighted categories. No waiting for a cloud server. No rate limits. Just fast, actionable diagnostics.

- **40+ individual checks** covering titles, descriptions, headings, images, links, canonicals, structured data, social tags, mobile readiness, and performance hints
- **10 scored categories** with weighted importance so you know which issues impact rankings most
- **Overall weighted score** from 0 to 100, giving you a single number to benchmark and track
- **Pass / Warning / Fail indicators** for every check, with clear explanations of why each rule matters
- **Actionable recommendations** — not just "this is wrong" but "here's what to do about it"

### Insights — AI That Never Leaves Your Browser

<!-- Icon suggestion: sparkle/star or brain icon -->

This is where Argus goes beyond every other free SEO tool. The Insights tab uses Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model to analyze your page and generate intelligent recommendations — entirely on-device. Your content never hits an external server. No API keys. No token limits. No privacy trade-offs.

- **Meta description rewriting** — AI generates optimized, click-worthy meta descriptions tailored to your page content
- **Title tag improvement** — get alternative title suggestions that balance keyword relevance with compelling copy
- **On-device processing** — Gemini Nano runs locally through Chrome's built-in AI APIs, so your page content stays private
- **Zero data transmission** — no analytics, no tracking, no third-party calls. Ever.

<!-- ========== SECTION: HOW IT WORKS ========== -->

## How It Works

Getting started with Argus takes less than thirty seconds. There's no signup form, no onboarding wizard, and no configuration required. Three steps and you're running a full SEO audit on any page on the web.

### Step 1 — Install

Add Argus to Chrome from the [Chrome Web Store](#chrome-web-store-link). It's free, lightweight, and requires minimal permissions. The installation takes seconds.

### Step 2 — Open the Side Panel

Navigate to any webpage and click the Argus icon in your browser toolbar. The side panel opens alongside your page — no popups, no new tabs, no disruption to your workflow.

### Step 3 — Get Instant Insights

Argus immediately extracts all meta tags, runs a full SEO audit, and surfaces AI-powered recommendations. Switch between the Extract, Audit, and Insights tabs to explore every dimension of your page's SEO health. Results auto-refresh whenever you navigate to a new page.

<!-- ========== SECTION: KEY CAPABILITIES ========== -->

## Everything You Need for On-Page SEO

Argus packs the functionality of multiple SEO tools into a single, fast Chrome extension. Here's what you can do the moment you install it — no premium tier, no feature gates, no "upgrade to unlock."

<!-- Developer note: Render these as a responsive grid of capability cards, ideally 2-3 columns on desktop, single column on mobile. Each card should have an icon, heading, and description. -->

### One-Click Meta Tag Extraction

Click the Argus icon and every meta tag on the page is instantly extracted and organized. Title, description, canonical, robots, viewport, charset — nothing is hidden. The fastest meta tag extractor available for Chrome.

### Live Social Share Preview Cards

See exactly how your page will appear when shared on Facebook, Twitter/X, and LinkedIn. Argus renders live previews from your Open Graph and Twitter Card tags so you can catch problems before your audience does.

### JSON-LD Validation with Syntax Highlighting

Structured data can make or break your rich results. Argus extracts all JSON-LD blocks, validates their structure, and displays them with full syntax highlighting so you can read and debug schema.org markup without leaving the page.

### Heading Hierarchy Visualization

A clean heading structure matters for accessibility and SEO alike. Argus maps every H1 through H6 in document order, making it trivial to spot skipped levels, duplicate H1s, or headings that break the logical hierarchy.

### 40+ Rule-Based SEO Audit Checks

Go beyond extraction with a comprehensive SEO audit tool built into the extension. Every check runs locally and instantly — covering titles, meta descriptions, heading structure, image alt text, link health, canonical tags, social tags, and more.

### Weighted Scoring Across 10 Categories

Not all SEO issues carry equal weight. Argus scores your page across 10 distinct categories using a weighted system that reflects real-world ranking impact, then rolls everything into a single 0-100 score you can track over time.

### AI-Powered Meta Description Rewriting

Writing compelling meta descriptions is tedious. Let Gemini Nano do the heavy lifting. Argus generates optimized meta description suggestions based on your actual page content — and the AI runs entirely on-device, so your content stays private.

### On-Device AI — Zero Data Leaves Your Browser

Unlike cloud-dependent SEO tools, Argus leverages Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano for all AI features. Your page content is never sent to an external server. No API keys to manage. No usage limits. No privacy compromises. This is what an AI SEO extension should look like.

### Export as JSON or Formatted Text

Need to share findings with your team or drop them into a report? Export extracted meta tags and audit results as clean JSON or a formatted text table. Copy to clipboard or save — whatever fits your workflow.

### Auto-Refreshes on Tab Switch

Argus stays in sync with your browsing. Switch to a new tab or navigate to a different URL and the side panel automatically re-runs extraction, auditing, and insights on the current page. No manual refresh button to click. Continuous, real-time SEO analysis as you browse.

<!-- ========== SECTION: WHY ARGUS ========== -->

## Why Argus?

There are plenty of Chrome SEO extensions. Most of them lock their best features behind a paywall, phone home with your browsing data, or require you to create an account before you can do anything useful. Argus takes a fundamentally different approach.

### 100% Free, No Account Required

Argus is completely free. Not freemium. Not "free for 7 days." Every feature — extraction, auditing, AI insights — is available from the moment you install, with no account creation, no email capture, and no feature limits. A truly free SEO tool for everyone.

### Privacy-First: Zero Data Collection

We built Argus with a strict no-collection policy. The extension contains no analytics, no tracking pixels, no telemetry, and no outbound API calls. Your browsing data stays in your browser. Period. In an era where most tools monetize your data, Argus monetizes nothing — because it's a free tool built by practitioners who care about the craft.

### AI-Powered with Gemini Nano, Entirely On-Device

The AI features in Argus aren't powered by a remote server — they run on Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model, directly on your device. That means AI-generated meta description suggestions and title improvements happen locally, with zero latency from network round-trips and zero risk of your content being processed externally. Private, fast, and genuinely intelligent.

### Built by SEO Practitioners at Pixelesq

Argus isn't a side project by developers who read a blog post about SEO. It's built by [Pixelesq](https://pixelesq.com), a team that works on SEO and AI-driven optimization every day. Every check, every rule, every scoring weight reflects real-world experience with the problems that actually affect search performance.
