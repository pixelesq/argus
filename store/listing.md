## Detailed Description (for Chrome Web Store listing page)

Argus is the all-seeing SEO inspector — named after the hundred-eyed giant of Greek mythology. Open the side panel on any page to instantly extract every meta tag, audit SEO health with 40+ checks, and get AI-powered recommendations using Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano.

🔍 EXTRACT — See everything search engines see
• Title tag with character count (green = optimal, amber = outside range)
• Meta description with length indicator
• Full Open Graph tags with a live social share preview card
• Twitter Card tags with a live Twitter preview
• JSON-LD structured data with syntax highlighting, type badges, and validation
• Heading hierarchy visualized as an indented tree
• Link summary — internal, external, nofollow counts
• Image audit — missing alt text, missing dimensions, lazy loading
• One-click copy for every field. Export as JSON or formatted text table.

📊 AUDIT — Know your score in seconds
Argus runs 40+ rule-based SEO checks across 10 categories and generates a weighted score from 0 to 100:
• Title — existence, length, OG consistency
• Description — existence, length, OG consistency
• Headings — H1 presence, single H1, hierarchy, empty headings
• Images — alt text, dimensions (CLS), lazy loading, modern formats
• Links — anchor text quality, empty hrefs, internal link density
• Technical — canonical, robots/noindex, HTTPS, viewport, lang, hreflang
• Structured Data — JSON-LD presence, validity, schema types, breadcrumbs
• Social — Open Graph, Twitter Card, image sizes
• Content — word count, thin content detection, reading time
• Performance — LCP, INP, CLS, TTFB via Web Vitals

Every issue is labeled critical, warning, or info with a clear explanation.

🤖 AI INSIGHTS — Powered by Gemini Nano (on-device)
When Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model is available, Argus automatically analyzes:
• Page classification — what the page is about and its search intent
• Meta description quality — evaluates or suggests improvements
• Content quality — identifies thin content signals and opportunities

On-demand AI actions:
• Rewrite meta description (optimized 140-155 chars with CTA)
• Improve title tag (keyword-front-loaded, 50-60 chars)
• Generate FAQ schema questions and answers
• Recommend Schema.org types for your page

All AI processing runs entirely on your device. No data is sent anywhere.

When Gemini Nano is not available, Argus still shows a full static analysis with content assessment, missing tag checklist, and rule-based schema recommendations.

🔒 PRIVACY
Argus works entirely client-side. No analytics, no tracking, no data collection, no external API calls. Your browsing data never leaves your browser.

The only external link is a single optional CTA to pixelesq.com — dismissible and never shown again.

⚡ BUILT FOR SPEED
• Side panel UI — stays open as you browse, auto-refreshes on tab switch
• Dark theme optimized for inspector workflows
• 288 KB total — lightweight, no bloat
• No external fonts or CDN dependencies

Built by Pixelesq — the AI-native platform for automated SEO optimization.

## Single Purpose Description (required for Chrome Web Store review)

This extension extracts SEO metadata from the currently active webpage and displays it in a side panel. It reads meta tags, Open Graph tags, Twitter Card tags, JSON-LD structured data, headings, links, and images from the page DOM. It then runs rule-based SEO audits on the extracted data and, if Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model is available, provides AI-generated recommendations for improving the page's SEO. All processing occurs locally in the browser. No data is transmitted to external servers.
